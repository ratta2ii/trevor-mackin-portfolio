                <p>
                  Becoming a Software Engineer still excites me today. It is
                  challenging, sometimes frustrating, of course, but incredibly
                  rewarding. It might be a new project completed, a new tool
                  implemented, or something as small as solving a bug. Yay! What
                  excitement, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please take some time to checkout a few of my{" "}
                  <a href="#/projects">PERSONAL PROJECTS</a>, each one
                  touching on various areas across the technological spectrum. A
                  project may include, implementing a database, authenticating
                  and authorizing users, working with various APIâ€™s (as both a
                  provider and consumer), taking advantage of the latest Cloud
                  Technologies (SaaS, PaaS, DBaaS, etc.), or even an instance -probably
                  many- of me flexing my design muscles. In every case, each
                  project will demonstrate an understanding of the topic at
                  hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And lastly, I am ready to take on the world. I am hungry,
                  motivated, intelligent, and I believe that I possess both the
                  focus, and determination, that it takes to remain successful
                  in this industry; and of course, always hoping to leave a
                  lasting impression along the way.
