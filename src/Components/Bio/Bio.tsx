          I am ready to take on the world. I am motivated, hungry, focused and
          determined to make a positive impact on this world. I am fully
          committed to always putting forth my best self, and consistently work
          towards bettering myself each and every day.

        <BioParagraph>
          Since the very first day that I made the decision to become a Software
          Engineer, it has always been about doing everything within my power to
          best prepare myself for this industry. Whether this be on the job
          grinding, building out a personal project, practicing algorithms, or
          even just reading about the latest technologies; regardless, I am
          always striving to improve my skills as a developer.

          To see some of my skills in action, please take a moment to checkout a
          few of my <BioAnchor href="#/projects">PERSONAL PROJECTS</BioAnchor>.
          Every project touches on different areas across the technological
          spectrum, with each one demonstrating an understanding of the topic at
          hand. Projects include, Security, Auth Services, working with various
          APIâ€™s (as both a provider and consumer), implementing Databases, Cloud
          Technologies (SaaS, PaaS, DBaaS, etc.), an instance -or two- of me
          flexing my design muscles, and much more. Thank you for taking the
          time to visit. Enjoy!
