          Becoming a Software Engineer still excites me today. It is
          challenging, sometimes frustrating, of course, but incredibly
          rewarding. It might be a new project completed, a new tool
          implemented, or something as small as solving a bug. Yay! What
          excitement, right?

          Please take some time to checkout a few of my{" "}
          <BioAnchor href="#/projects">PERSONAL PROJECTS</BioAnchor>, each one
          touching on various areas across the technological spectrum. A project
          may include, implementing a database, authenticating and authorizing
          users, working with various APIâ€™s (as both a provider and consumer),
          taking advantage of the latest Cloud Technologies (SaaS, PaaS, DBaaS,
          etc.), or even an instance -probably many- of me flexing my design
          muscles. In every case, each project will demonstrate an understanding
          of the topic at hand.

          And lastly, I am ready to take on the world. I am hungry, motivated,
          intelligent, and I believe that I possess both the focus, and
          determination, that it takes to remain successful in this industry;
          and of course, always hoping to leave a lasting impression along the
          way.
